### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    One of my favorite labs was lab 4, part 2 because I love 
    problem-solving and this part was a good challenge for me. 
    After testing the code a couple of times, I was able to figure 
    out specifically what I did wrong and how I needed to fix the errors. 
    Overall, I had a fun time creating a program that resembles a 
    high/low guessing game. In the high/low guessing game, the trial 
    and error aspect and designing the program ourselves was really fun.

* Lab 5

    Another lab that I liked was lab 5, part 2 because it was also 
    another fun challenge for me to problem-solve as I was coding 
    and going through the flowcharts. After testing the code a couple 
    of times, I was able to figure out specifically what I did wrong 
    and how I needed to fix the errors. Overall, I had a great time 
    creating a program that converts feet to inches. It was easy to 
    implement once you got the logistics down and planning of how 
    the conversion actually happens. The coding is easy once you 
    have a solid plan of how you are going to implement this.  

* Lab 7

    Another lab that I really enjoyed was lab 7, part 2 because it 
    was also another fun challenge for me to problem-solve as I was 
    coding and going through the flowcharts. After testing the code a 
    couple of times, I was able to figure out specifically what I did 
    wrong and how I needed to fix the errors. Overall, I had a great 
    time creating a program that determines whether street parking is 
    allowed. In this assignment, I realized the importance of iterative 
    testing. It was really helpful that I coded and ran my code rather 
    than all at once.
